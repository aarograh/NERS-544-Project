The infinite lattice (pin cell) problem was successfully simulated using a Monte Carlo program.  Estimators were used to determine the value of k-eff and axial leakages for the pin cell as a function of pin pitch.  The values obtained were consistent with the expectations for this kind of problem, indicating that code is producing correct results.
