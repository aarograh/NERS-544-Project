The purpose of this project was to apply Monte Carlo simulation techniques to some semi-realistic problem.  The problem selected for this purpose was eigenvalue calculations for a pin cell.  The pin cell had a radius of 1.5 cm and a height of 100 cm.  The pin cell had reflecting boundary conditions radially and vacuum boundary conditions axially, making this problem an eigenvalue calculation for an infinite lattice. 

The eigenvalue was calculated using both track-length and collision estimators in the fuel region, as well as a ``rough estimate'' of the eigenvalue calculated from the number of fissions caused by each generation.  Additionally, current estimators were placed on the top and bottom surfaces of the pin cell to calculate the leakage out of the pin cell.  These calculations allowed observation of the behavior properties of Monte Carlo methods as applied to an infinite lattice calculation.
